    "text": "I am currently writing an open-source textbook based on my teaching titled Data Analysis for Journalism and Political Communication. The book is an introduction to the principles of data analysis and data communication for journalists and political professionals. Special sections cover applications to political polling and machine learning. In addition, readers will be introduced to the R programming language through coding exercises embedded directly in the e-book. Topics include:\n\nThe data generating process\n\nData sources and researcher bias\nOperationalization and measurement bias\nRandomization and selection bias\nSample size and uncertainty\nMissing data and outliers\nApplication in R: Exploratory data analysis\n\nCorrelation vs. causation\n\nPositive and negative correlation\nRubin causal model\nExperiments\nCausal inference using observational data\nSubstantive vs. statistical effects\nApplication in R: Analysis of Gerber and Greeen (2000)\n\nMeasuring uncertainty\n\nThe sampling distribution\nType I vs. Type II error\nP-values\nConfidence intervals\nApplication in R: The dangers of “crosstab diving” in polls\n\nData ethics\n\nThe Belmont Report and the Common Rule\nInformed consent\nCase studies of ethical challenges in data\nDe-identification\nApplication in R: De-identifying administrative data\n\nData visualization\n\nHistorical development of data visualization\nEdward Tufte’s design principles\nThe science of data visualization\nEngineers vs. designers\nAn opinionated guide to data visualization\nApplication in R: Re-creating Charles Minard’s famous graph of Napoleon’s invasion of Russia\n\nPolitical polling\n\nHistorical development of political polling\nTotal survey error framework\nReview of 2016, 2020, 2022, and 2024 election polling\nIgnorable vs. non-ignorable response bias\nSample weighting\nSample construction and survey techniques\nSurvey design best practices\nAdvances in AI and political polling\nApplication: Weighting polls to correct for ignorable non-response bias\n\nMachine Learning (content TBA)\n\nAnticipated publication date is December 2025."
