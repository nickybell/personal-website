I have 11 years of experience as a data analytics and product leader, using my social science background and statistical expertise to turn messy, complex, and unstructured data into transformative tools and insights. My career highlights include launching the analytics team at [Clairity, Inc](https://www.clairity.com/), an AI medical device startup where I generated \$7+ million in business value by driving new product development, deploying innovative methodologies, and finding cost-saving software and workflow efficiencies.

I am also part of the professional faculty at the [School of Media and Public Affairs](https://smpa.gwu.edu/) at George Washington University, where I teach courses on data analysis for journalism and political communication. I enjoy making complex topics in statistics accessible to students so that they become better producers, consumers, and communicators of data.

I received my Ph.D. in political science (quantitative focus) from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.polisci.upenn.edu/){target="_blank"} in 2022. I find connections between my research and my work in asking, "How can this product deliver greater value to a larger share of the market?" My dissertation focused on improving service delivery of a federal job training program called Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and evaluating how different messages about TAA affect public support for this program.

I live in Washington, D.C., with my wife and cat. In my free time, I follow Formula 1 racing, play pickleball, and am working on my [first book](book_project.qmd).
