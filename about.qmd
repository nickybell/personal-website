## Builder. Entrepreneur. Educator.

My specialty is creating the teams, products, and processes that drive revenue and operational excellence. In 2025, I joined [Keywell.ai](https://keywell.ai/) as its first Chief of Staff. I ensure that the organization scales effectively and sustainably through strategic planning, cross-functional coordination, process implementation, hiring, performance management, and financial stewardship. I work directly with the Founder and CEO to implement a vision that positions Keywell as the go-to name for AI scaffolding in health and human services.

I'm also the Founder and CEO of Powered Analysis, a dual-focus AI company dedicated to raising the standard of automated data analysis. We offer no-code, no-math education to help professionals apply a "Data Analyst Mindset" to AI outputs, and we're developing **Circuit**, a validation layer that catches the statistical errors LLMs miss.

Previously, I was Founding Director of Data Science at [Clairity](https://clairity.com/){target="_blank"}, where I contributed to the first FDA-approved computer vision algorithm for predicting breast cancer risk. I was also the first Analytics Lead at [FlagshipRTL](https://flagshiprtl.com/) and oversaw data-driven policy programs supported by the Carnegie Corporation and the MacArthur Foundation at William & Mary's [Global Research Institute](https://www.wm.edu/offices/global-research/).

Since 2020, I've been an adjunct professor of data science at George Washington University's [School of Media and Public Affairs](https://smpa.gwu.edu/) and in the University of Pennsylvania's [Data Analytics Certificate program](https://lpsonline.sas.upenn.edu/academics/certificates/data-analytics). I enjoy making complex statistical topics accessible to students so they become better producers, consumers, and communicators of data.

I earned my Ph.D. in quantitative political science from the [University of Pennsylvania](https://www.polisci.upenn.edu/) in 2022. I find connections between my research and my work by asking, "How can this product deliver greater value to a larger share of the market?" My dissertation focused on improving service delivery of a federal job training program called Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) and evaluating how different messages about TAA affect public support for the program.

I also hold an M.A. in European Studies from the [Universiteit van Amsterdam](https://www.uva.nl/), where I was a Rotary Ambassadorial Scholar, and a B.A. (honors) in International Relations from the [College of William & Mary](https://www.wm.edu/), where I graduated Phi Beta Kappa and *summa cum laude*.

I'm a proud native of Erie, PA, and I currently live and work in Washington, D.C.
